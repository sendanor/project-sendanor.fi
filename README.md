# Product Management for sendanor.fi website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for sendanor.fi's public product management. This repository is the central hub for tracking issues and developments related to our website, https://sendanor.fi.

## Contribution and Issue Tracking

We encourage you to participate in our development process. You can find and contribute to our discussions on software development through our [Issues page](https://github.com/sendanor/project-sendanor.fi/issues). Here, you will encounter three main types of issues that guide our work:

1. **Development Overview Issue:** Tracks the overall development progress of sendanor.fi.
2. **Next Release Issue:** Pinned to track the forthcoming iteration of development.
3. **Backlog Issue:** Contains all tasks and developments pending allocation to a release.

### Community Engagement

Join our community on Discord! We host a Finnish-speaking [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/dVTpkTh) for customers and staff to discuss, share, and connect. Additionally, we contribute to [the HyperifyIO project](https://github.com/hyperifyio), which maintains its own English-speaking [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/UBTrHxA78f).

### Issue Hierarchy

Our product management is streamlined into four levels of issues, ensuring clarity and focus in our development efforts:

- **Index Issue (`index`):** Serves as the master tracker for all development activities, including project and backlog issues.
- **Project Issues (`project`):** Represent a development iteration or release, encompassing various tasks and bugs.
- **Task Issues (`task` or `bug`):** The primary unit of work, ideally broken down into manageable steps achievable within a single release.
- **Subtask Issues (`subtask`):** Detailed components of a task or bug, either tracked as separate GitHub issues or as checklist items within a task issue.

### Work Estimates

We adopt a straightforward approach to estimating development progress through [ticket counting](https://info.thoughtworks.com/rs/thoughtworks2/images/twebook-perspectives-estimation_1.pdf). Experience shows that detailed time estimates are often unnecessary. By splitting tasks into the smallest feasible units, we find that the average completion time becomes a constant. Assuming an average of one (1) story point per item, we standardize all tasks to this value, simplifying our estimation process to merely counting tasks/subtasks. This method has proven effective and efficient, allowing us to focus more on actual development work.
