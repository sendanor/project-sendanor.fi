# sendanor.fi Product Management

Welcome to the GitHub repository for sendanor.fi's public product management. This repository is the central hub for tracking issues and developments related to our website, https://sendanor.fi.

## Contribution and Issue Tracking

We encourage you to participate in our development process. You can find and contribute to our discussions on software development through our [Issues page](https://github.com/sendanor/project-sendanor.fi/issues). Here, you will encounter three main types of issues that guide our work:

1. **Development Overview Issue:** Tracks the overall development progress of sendanor.fi.
2. **Next Release Issue:** Pinned to track the forthcoming iteration of development.
3. **Backlog Issue:** Contains all tasks and developments pending allocation to a release.

### Community Engagement

Join our community on Discord! We host a Finnish-speaking [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/dVTpkTh) for customers and staff to discuss, share, and connect. Additionally, we contribute to [the HyperifyIO project](https://github.com/hyperifyio), which maintains its own English-speaking [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/UBTrHxA78f).

### Issue Hierarchy

Our product management is streamlined into four levels of issues, ensuring clarity and focus in our development efforts:

- **Index Issue (`index`):** Serves as the master tracker for all development activities, including project and backlog issues.
- **Project Issues (`project`):** Represent a development iteration or release, encompassing various tasks and bugs.
- **Task Issues (`task` or `bug`):** The primary unit of work, ideally broken down into manageable steps achievable within a single release.
- **Subtask Issues (`subtask`):** Detailed components of a task or bug, either tracked as separate GitHub issues or as checklist items within a task issue.

### Work Estimates

We adopt a straightforward approach to estimating development progress through [ticket counting](https://info.thoughtworks.com/rs/thoughtworks2/images/twebook-perspectives-estimation_1.pdf). Experience shows that detailed time estimates are often unnecessary. By splitting tasks into the smallest feasible units, we find that the average completion time becomes a constant. Assuming an average of one (1) story point per item, we standardize all tasks to this value, simplifying our estimation process to merely counting tasks/subtasks. This method has proven effective and efficient, allowing us to focus more on actual development work.
